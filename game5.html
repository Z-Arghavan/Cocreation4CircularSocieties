            <p>LCA stands for Life Cycle Assessment. It is a systematic method used to evaluate the environmental impact of a product, process, or service throughout its entire lifecycle. The impacts are reported in terms of carbon emissions (amongst other impact categories). Therefore, we can compare products through LCA.<br> The assessment typically covers 5 life cycle stages:</p>
            <ol style="text-align: left;">
                <li><strong>Raw Material Extraction</strong>: Evaluates the impact of obtaining the raw materials used in the product.</li>
                <li><strong>Manufacturing</strong>: Assesses the energy and resources required to make the product and any pollution resulting from the production processes.</li>
                <li><strong>Transportation</strong>: Considers the environmental impact of transporting raw materials and the finished product.</li>
                <li><strong>Use Phase</strong>: Looks at the impact of using the product, including energy consumption and emissions during its use.</li>
                <li><strong>End-of-Life</strong>: Assesses disposal, recycling, or reuse of the product, including the impacts of waste treatment.</li>
            </ol>
