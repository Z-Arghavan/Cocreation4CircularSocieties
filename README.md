# Circular Built Environment Mini-game hub

This repository contains four independent digital mini-games developed as part of **The Green Escape: Return from the Future** ‚Äì an educational escape room presented at [Dutch Design Week 2024](https://ddw.nl/en/programme/12315/the-green-escape-return-from-the-future) and other public events.

The games are designed to raise awareness about sustainability and circularity in the built environment, using interactive and engaging digital formats.


Each game follows:

- **Bloom‚Äôs Revised Taxonomy**: an educational farmework for adult learning and education.
- **Kolb‚Äôs Experiential Learning Cycle**: supporting learning through doing, reflecting, and applying cycle.
- **Three Purposes for Sustainable Built Environment Framework (3P4SB)**: A new serious game design framework developed by Arghavan Akbarieh.

The games are standalone, except for **Green Glossary**, which reinforces concepts from the earlier games to encourage knowledge retention.
